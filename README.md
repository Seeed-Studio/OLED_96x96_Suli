It is a 16 color grayscale 96Ã—96 dot matrix OLED display module with Grove compatible 4pin I2C interface. Grove - OLED 96x96 is constructed with 96 x 96 dot matrix OLED module LY120 and SSD1327 driver IC. Comparing to LCD, OLED screens are more competitive, which has a number of advantages such as high brightness, self-emission, high contrast ratio, slim / thin outline, wide viewing angle, wide temperature range, and low power consumption.

***For Arduino:***

Just like you use the other Library, What's different is you should download Suli for Arduino First, remember that just put Suli for Arduino to your Arduino libraries folder.

***For non-Arduino Platform:***

For a non-Arduino platform, what you need is xxx.h and xxx.cpp(you can change it to xxx.c while your compiler can't support c++), the other files like xxx_Arduino.h and examples is for Arduino, you can just delete them.
